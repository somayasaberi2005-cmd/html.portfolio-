     For thousands of years, it stood at the crossroads of great empires — where<br>
    the Silk Road carried traders, scholars, and dreamers between East and West.<br>
     From the mighty empires of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan to the birth<br>
     of powerful dynasties like the Durrani Empire, Afghanistan has always been a <br>
     land of resilience and pride. Its mountains have witnessed countless battles, <br>
    yet its spirit remains unbroken — a land rich in culture, poetry, and courage <br>
    that continues to inspirethe world.</p1>
